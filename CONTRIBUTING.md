# Contributing
## Convention
Please make sure you are following the conventions of the existing code.

## Branches
Make your branch names short yet descriptive of whats in them. 
You should also be keeping them up to date with `master`

## Commit messages
Keep them short, under 50 characters is ideal. 
Make them [atomic][1], one commit message should pair with one change. 
If you have to add an “and” in your commit message, you’ve already committed too much.

## Pull requests
Provide a short description of what the code does and why it should be added to the project.
Bullet lists of the contribution are fine and should be easy if your commit messages are also simple.
