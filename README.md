## What is Chameleon?
It consists of several frameworks, the core of which are:

* **Models**: Exposes Slack model data. Slack's APIs only provide object ids in their responses, however the model layer is able to convert those into _full_ model objects. 
* **WebAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Web API.
* **RTMAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Real-time messaging API.
* **Bot**: Utilises  Provides an extensible Slack bot user.

## Features
* [x] **Extensible**: `SlackService`'s can be added to provide any behaviour you need.
* [x] **Typed**: You always get to work with _full_ typed Slack model data.

## ⚠️ Work in Progress
This is a work in progress so expect improvements as well as breaking changes!

Chameleon is *functional* however there is still a lot to do before it is *complete*

* The Web and Real time messaging APIs can do _a lot_ - 
I have built support for the core/most common features but they are incomplete. 
I will add more over time until they are complete.

#Acknowledgement
This was my first dive into 'Server Side Swift'; 
95% of this code was done over a total of a few days but getting working in the terminal 
and then deployed to Heroku took far longer... This project would likely have ended up as 
mostly useless OSX app if it hadn't been for the teams from [Vapor](http://qutheory.io/) and [Zewo](http://www.zewo.io/)
pioneering the server side Swift movement. I am especially thankful for the help and patience of
